## Description

_Gosuken is a game we have created where two players fight until one is crowned victorious. It was inspired by a very famous game called Street Fighter. We used ruby and gosu to create the beautiful masterpiece. Each player is able to attack each other by punching and kicking while their health is declining and experience is increasing. Once your experience is full you can use your special move to destroy your enemy. Have fun, may the best warrior win._
